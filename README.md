# Reviews

This project consists of the reviews microservice which feeds review data to the Project Atelier client-side. The goals of this project was to rebuild an existing API which provides product reviews per product. Optimized queries using PostgreSQL with Node.js and Express.js resulted in query times under 50ms. This microservice was also load tested up to 1k RPS.
